[] Remove the inhibition function and replcae current density-denpendent mortality by food-density-dependent rate and mortality
[x] Replace current evaporation by Ivanov model
* Note: This resulted in zero negatives and diminution of calls
[] Make W a vectorial function.(QG-QR and then apply bounds to make it be in [0,vBS_c])
[] Use water level instead of water volume
